# BGImageGrabber
An Application that Grabs Background Images from Osu! maps and saves them to a specified folder.
First things first: The difficulty name search has not been implented yet, so it does not work.
Download all files and have them in the same folder. Then click on setup and it should install the program. 
After that, the program should run.
To run the program again, either use the .exe or the launcher.
There is a default save location if you do not choose one: "Users\(Your Username)"\Pictures\ImageGrabber
